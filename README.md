* **Healthcare Management System:** The core application logic for managing patients, appointments, and other administrative tasks.
* **Patient Management:** (e.g., Add, edit, and search for patient records)
* **Appointment Scheduling:** (e.g., Book, cancel, and view upcoming appointments)

*(Please update this list with more of your project's specific features!)*

## Technology Stack

* **Language:** C#
* **Framework:** .NET (Windows Forms)
* **IDE:** Visual Studio (`.sln` file)

## UI/UX Inspiration

The user interface and visual design of this project are heavily inspired by the "Modern Flat UI" concept demonstrated by **RJ Code Advance**. The goal was to create an engaging and visually appealing application using modern design principles, random multi-color themes, and active button highlighting.
